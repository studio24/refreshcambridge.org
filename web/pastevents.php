                        <p>We've recently kicked Refresh off again with a meetup in September at a new venue, the <a href="http://www.thecambridgebrewhouse.com">Cambridge Brew House</a></p>

                        <p><a href="http://www.garethrushgrove.com/">Gareth Rushgrove</a> talked about the Gov.uk project (link to: https://www.gov.uk/) and lessons he's learnt on running large websites. It was a fascinating talk that provoked lots of talk in the bar afterwards. Gareth's slides are available at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/operating-gov-dot-uk">https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/operating-gov-dot-uk</a></p>

                        <p><a href="http://www.simonrjones.net/">Simon Jones</a> talked about recent developments in PHP including regular release cycles, improvements to OO and the excellent new password_hash function in PHP 5.5. Simon's slides are available at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/simonrjones/modern-php">http://www.slideshare.net/simonrjones/modern-php</a></p>

                    <div class="eventContent">
                        <p>We had around 20 people to listen to talks from Andy
Field, Julian Price and Anthony Albertyn on ExpressionEngine,
SilverStripe and Drupal. The discussions were lively after the talks, and it gave people new ideas on using CMS tools. We had a draw for a free "freelancer"
license for ExpressionEngine, from the kind people at <a href="http://ellislab.com">EllisLabs</a> which Rachael Beale won.</p>

<p>The event was kindly sponsored by <a href="http://www.creativefront.org">CreativeFront</a> who supplied free drinks and snacks, and was held at <a href="http://www.anglia.ac.uk">Anglia Ruskin University</a> who have hosted Refresh meetups for the past few years. </p>
