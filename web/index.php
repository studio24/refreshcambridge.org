                    <h2>Joel Hughes</h2>
                    <p>Joel has been working in the web industry for over 15 years and in his talk he'll cover some of the mistakes he's made 
                    (there have been a few) and he'll look at tactics which can help. Knowing how to design websites is one thing. Knowing how 
                    to handle the business side is something completely different. He welcomes questions (excluding those from whacko Moon 
                    landing conspiracy theorists).</p>
                    <p>Joel is visiting Cambridge on his roadshow promoting the new <a href="http://2014.thebusinessofwebdesign.co.uk/">Business of Web Design conference</a> in Cardiff in July.</p>
                    <p>Drinks for the night will be kindly provided by <a href="https://workingatbooking.com/­">Booking.com</a></p>
